## Key Features

## How to use

This is **template repository**.
You can create your own repository from that template using [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
Alternatively, clone/download this repository and use it as a starting point for your plugin.

### First build

After your plugin directory is ready, run:

```shell
hatch build --target kicad-package
```

After a while you should get output similar to this:

```shell
[kicad-package]
package details:
{
  "download_sha256": "6d9aa77cea16b5edee478e4eb36c4e2c2a1c012201240767329363f116563312",
  "download_size": 7961,
  "install_size": 9259
}
dist/kicad_plugin_template-0.1.0.zip
```

Build result is located in `dist/` directory. You can install it with KiCad's `Plugin and Content Manager` using `Install From File...` option:

![install-from-file](resources/install-from-file.png)

To check if it is working, open `PCB Editor`. Plugin icon should be on the toolbar.
If everything is ok, clicking it will result in following window:

![icon-and-gui-window](resources/icon-and-gui-window.png)


And that's it! Your plugin template is ready for development.

### Hatch project manager

This template is using [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest) with [hatch-kicad](https://github.com/adamws/hatch-kicad) plugin.
Thanks to this build system it is possible to create KiCad compatible package file with single command.
All settings used in this process are located in `pyproject.toml` file.

At this stage you should start customizing project defaults. Open `pyproject.toml` and modify `kicad-package` section:

```toml
[tool.hatch.build.targets.kicad-package]
name = "Template"
# ...remaining options
```

These options controls plugin content and metadata. Metadata values will become important
when publishing to KiCad's plugin repository. To learn more about `kicad-package` builder see [this](https://github.com/adamws/hatch-kicad#builder).

Hatch is also used for running development tools in isolated environment.
For example, to get linting results using `ruff`, `black` and `mypy`, run:

```shell
hatch run lint:all
```

To run code formatting run:

```shell
hatch run lint:fmt
```

## Testing

Testing environment is not isolated (unlike `tool.hatch.envs.lint`) because it requires `pcbnew` package
which is installed and managed by KiCad. [todo: more details]

To execute tests run `pytest` command.
